This is my personal clone of Advance Wars, cause that game is awesome. Hopefully I'll actually be able to finish it!

If you'd like to try it out for yourself, either download the source and compile it in your IDE of choice, or dowload
the directory as a zip and double click on the AdvanceWars.jar file. It should start up right away!
